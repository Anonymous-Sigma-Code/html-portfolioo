<h1>Joshua's Top 3 Movies of ALL TIME</h1>
 <h2>These are movies you should definitely watch</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>1. The Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl</h3>
 <p>This movie is somewhat considered a classic, starring classic actors such as Johnny Depp and
    Geoffrey Rush. I really like the silly, simple humour of this film.
 </p>
 <h3>2. Big Hero 6</h3>
 <p>A very cool animated movie. I really love the idea behind the movie that some science geeks can become superheroes.</p>
<h3>3. Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>If you love fast cars doing incredible stunts, then this is the movie for you. It is also set in the beautiful scenery of tokyo, Japan.</p>
